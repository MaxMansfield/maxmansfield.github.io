###### My first experiences as a low-level programmer with Jekyll, the github pages hosting and my continuing ruby exploration
<!--more-->
![Github + Jekyll](http://bitbyteyum.com/images/posts/jekyll+github.png)

It all started as I amassed documentation from a recent project I've been working on for AVR8 chips (called [Cavrn](https://github.com/MaxMansfield/Cavrn)) I realized that I had nowhere useful to deliver my html based documentation with. Right as I saw Github pages I knew it was a fit but I couldn't choose the stack immediatley, so after a bit of fussing I landed on [Jekyll-bootstrap-matierial by sentenza](https://github.com/sentenza/jekyll-material-design) on github.
